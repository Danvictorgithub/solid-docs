This guide is for TailwindCSS v4. For **Tailwind CSS v3** refer to [TailwindCSS v3](/guides/styling-components/tailwind-v3).

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is an on-demand utility CSS library that integrates seamlessly with Solid as a built-in PostCSS plugin. 

## Installation

1. Install Tailwind CSS as a development dependency:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```
</div>

<div id="yarn">
```bash frame="none"
yarn add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```
</div>

<div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```
</div>

<div id="bun">
```bash frame="none"
bun add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

2. Add `@tailwind/postcss` to the `plugins`in your PostCSS configuration. If you do not have a PostCSS configuration file, create a new one called `postcss.config.mjs`.

```js
/* postcss.config.mjs */
export default {
	plugins: {
		"@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
	}
}
```

As of Tailwind CSS v4, **tailwind.config.js** is no longer required.

For a deeper dive into configuration, you can check out the [Tailwind Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

## Add Tailwind directives

In your `src/index.css` file, add the following Tailwind directives:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

These directives ensure that Tailwind CSS is properly initialized and establish the correct order for utilities. You can append custom CSS below these directives.

## Import TailwindCSS

Import your `index.css` file into the root `index.jsx` or `index.tsx` file:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web"
import App from "./App"
import "./index.css"

render(() => <App />, document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement);
```

## Usage

With Tailwind CSS set up, you can now utilize its utility classes.
For instance, if you previously had a `Card.css` file, you can replace or remove it:

```
/* src/components/Card.css */
/* Remove or replace these styles with Tailwind utility classes */
```

Update your components to use Tailwind's utility classes:

```jsx
/* src/components/Card.jsx */
function Card() {
	return (
		<div class="grid place-items-center min-h-screen">
			<div class="h-[160px] aspect aspect-[2] rounded-[16px] shadow-[0_0_0_4px_hsl(0_0%_0%_/_15%)]">
				Hello, world!
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```
